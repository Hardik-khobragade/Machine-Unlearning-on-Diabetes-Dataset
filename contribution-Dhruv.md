# Project Contribution: SISA Data Preparation Pipeline (Team 1)
### My role in Team 1 centered on executing the final stage of the data preparation pipeline (Cell 3 & 4) and finalizing the core user mapping structure (Cell 2).

## Implementation & File Delivery
### User Mapping Refinement
I updated the user mapping logic in Cell 2 for some part to ensure the user_mapping.json provided row-level traceability.

## Pipeline Execution (Cell 3 & 4)
I was responsible for the complete execution of the main() function, with the shard,split configuration.

## File Management
I implemented and ran the file-saving logic, successfully generating and naming all final split files (e.g., shard_0_split_0.csv) and the comprehensive user_mapping.json.

## Quality Check
I performed a final quality assurance run, confirming that the output files were correctly saved and that the mapping for 20 users was complete, verifying the entire partitioning process worked as intended.
